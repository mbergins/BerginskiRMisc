Miscellaneous R Functions of General Use in Plotting and Manipulating Data

Following from Hilary Parker's [short guide](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) on setting up your own R package, I'm starting to move some of my more general R functions into a package.

Most of these functions will relate to custom plotting, as I seem to use R most for plotting needs. Otherwise, I expect some functions for gluing various data types together will also be added.


Installation
------------

The devtools package is required to install this package, it can be installed using:

```R
library('devtools'); 
install_github('mbergins/BerginskiRMisc');
```
